                <summary>Overview
                    <!-- <span class="faq-open-icon">+</span> -->

                </summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">The client is a well-known, popular preschool that contacted me
                    because they had a steady rise in students with celiac disease, as well as students whose
                    parents or guardians preferred they consume a gluten-free diet.

                    The preschool lost clients in recent years because the kitchen could not accommodate their
                    dietary needs. There was also a rise in negative online reviews regarding how the food was
                    prepared for students with celiac disease.

                    I analyzed student enrollment trends, parent and guardian surveys, kitchen space, and daily meal
                    routines. I determined that staff members lacked the knowledge and procedural skills necessary
                    to prepare gluten-free food safely for those with celiac disease in a shared kitchen.

                    I suggested a scenario-based eLearning experience that allowed cooks to simultaneously learn
                    about celiac disease and its potential symptoms and health impacts as well as practice making
                    key decisions necessary to prepare gluten-free food safely for those with celiac disease.
                    In this eLearning experience, the learner navigates through a real-life kitchen scenario where
                    they need to make important decisions about the process of preparing gluten-free food in a
                    shared kitchen. Throughout the experience, a mentor character named Julia helps the user avoid
                    cross-contamination. <img src="/src/images/2021-10-18_8-56-16.png"

                <summary>Process: Designing Backwards </summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">I began the process by working with the Subject Matter Expert (SME)
                    to create an action map. After determining the top actions that the learner should perform, I
                    created the text-based storyboard. Following approval from the SME on the text-based storyboard,
                    I designed the visual mockups using Adobe XD. Using the text-based storyboard and visual
                    mockups, I created the visual storyboard with included programming notes.

                    I designed five different animations that highlighted the positives or negatives of each tool.
                    These animations include strategically placed sound effects to immerse the learner as they
                    interact with and watch the consequence play out. It was important for this project to show, not
                    just tell, the learner the results of using each tool to help facilitate real-world behavior
                    change.

                    I then created an interactive prototype in Articulate Storyline. After incorporating the
                    feedback from the SME on the prototype, I developed the project in Storyline.
                    Process
                    I consulted with two subject matter experts (SMEs) for this project: the owner of the preschool
                    and a specialist in food preparation for those with celiac disease. By working closely with both
                    experts, I completed the following tasks.

                    Defined the eLearning goal and created an action map using Mindmeister.

                    Wrote a text-based storyboard with varied consequences and a strong focus on storytelling.

                    Designed the visuals for the project by iterating in Adobe XD.

                    Ensured the eLearning experience functioned as planned by prototyping in Articulate Storyline
                    360 and making appropriate changes when needed.

                    Developed the final product in Articulate Storyline 360.

                    Interviewing
                    I started this project by interviewing a learner who wants to learn basic skills in video
                    editing. She had no experience in video editing and wanted to make a video without any
                    subscription fee. Moreover, she wanted to learn the most useful features that would be
                    frequently used. Therefore, I decided to create a series of screencast videos to help learners
                    like her learn how to use iMovie, a software that everyone can access for free. </span>

            <details class="faq-card">
                <summary>Action Map<span class="faq-open-icon"></span></summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">I created an action map with the SME to identify the actions that the
                    learner should perform in order to complete the goal. Once we determined that over-reliance on
                    email when communicating was the problem, we worked together to establish the situations in
                    which email was being used inefficiently and which communication tool to use instead. Using this
                    information, I created an action map that focused on the three most impactful actions people
                    could take to communicate more effectively. After identifying the problem and proposed
                    solutions, I met again with the celiac disease subject matter expert who defined the most
                    important actions needed for cooks to prepare gluten-free food safely with zero
                    cross-contamination.

                    Through further collaboration with both subject matter experts, I created an action map using
                    Mindmeister, which narrowed down the list of observable actions that cooks needed to perform in
                    order to achieve the goal.

                    These actions included:

                    Choosing a naturally gluten-free food

                    Cleaning shared spaces (counters) using warm and soapy water

                    Sharing only certain types of pots and pans (no cast iron, wooden utensils)

                    Washing and drying shared pots and pans with an unused sponge and paper towels

                    Choosing packaged foods with the correct gluten-free label
                    Mind Map
                    Before developing videos, I created a mind map that lists common features that users are often
                    using for video editing. Then, I ranked each feature according to the level of difficulty. With
                    the help of this mind map, I divided the content into five videos.
                    The first video is about importing files and creating events. I demonstrate splitting, cutting,
                    and manipulating the timeline in the second video. In the third one, I talked about how to add
                    audio effects, titles, and transitions. In the fourth video, I also showed how to make color
                    adjustments, such as color balance and color correction. The last video is about how to make
                    noise reduction, picture-in-picture, and speed adjustment.

            <details class="faq-card">
                <summary>Text-based Storyboard<span class="faq-open-icon"></span></summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">Once the action map was complete, I worked with the SME to create a
                    text-based storyboard. Each question was based on the action that we wanted people to practice,
                    and we made sure to situate each question within the real-world context. The scenarios were
                    based on the following problems:

                    Long-Term Team Projects: The Leadership team was primarily using email to communicate back and
                    forth when working on projects throughout the semester. When past communication or information
                    needed to be retrieved, it was very difficult to sift through email threads (sometimes
                    months-long), leading to missed deadlines and general inefficiency.

                    School Board Presentations: Various Leadership Team members were regularly asked to present at
                    School Board meetings. When PowerPoint slides were updated through email, information was hard
                    to find and important revisions had been overlooked due to multiple copies of the same document
                    being created and shared. This has led to decisions being made on faulty information and was
                    important for the client to address since it can easily be avoided by using a shared document.

                    Feedback from Large Groups: Members of the Leadership Team regularly receive feedback from large
                    numbers of school district staff. When receiving information through individual email responses,
                    they would frequently get overwhelmed with the sheer volume and use valuable time to synthesize
                    the feedback instead of using a tool that would synthesize the information autonomously.
                    Important feedback could be ignored and overlooked, in addition to the time wasted.
                    I designed three scenarios in which the learner would have to make a realistic decision on the
                    most efficient communication tool to use. To make the situations more immersive and realistic, I
                    incorporated storytelling elements and mirrored the real-world context.

                    Working with the SME, I designed the consequences of each scenario to highlight the results of
                    each choice. For example, to drive home the inefficiencies of using email, I created an
                    animation sequence that showed an inbox quickly filling up with emails. This realistic animation
                    shows what it is like to be bombarded with email responses and how quickly a full email inbox
                    becomes overwhelming.

                    Along the way, the learner would be able to ask the mentor character for help if they were
                    unsure of what to do in a situation. Once the action map was complete and approved, I developed
                    a text-based storyboard that outlined the story, questions, answer choices, and consequences.

                    In the eLearning experience, learners navigate through five different decision points where they
                    must make the correct choice. All choices lead to a unique consequence based on their choice.

                    To make the scenario more engaging, educational and story-based, I created a mentor character
                    named Julia. Julia acts as a guide, and she shares her perspective throughout the experience.

                    Through the memories that Julia shares from her experience, learners understand the negative
                    physical and social impacts that cross-contamination can have for people with celiac, as well as
                    the positivity that can be imparted when correctly following the procedures.

                <summary>Visual Mockups <span class="faq-open-icon"></span></summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">I created my visual mockups in Adobe XD so that I could make several
                    iterations and quickly change different elements. In addition to Adobe XD, I also utilized Adobe
                    Illustrator heavily for this project. By using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD, I was able to
                    manipulate and edit vector graphics in Illustrator and then bring them to my mockups in XD.I
                    paid careful attention to design principles such as repetition and balance while also
                    incorporating color and value to give subtle visual clues that were woven throughout the
                    eLearning experience. For example, I chose a calming green theme because this topic can be
                    intimidating.

                    After receiving feedback on my visual mockups I used a different green color with better
                    contrast for the buttons, created a more subtle hover state, and redesigned my job aid slide. I
                    made numerous iterations of visual mockups before settling on the final design.

                    Once
                    the SME approved the text-based storyboard, I designed the visual mockups for the project in
                    Adobe XD. Adobe XD allowed for quick iteration and easy sharing to make improvements to the
                    visual design of the project. I was quickly able to incorporate feedback from my peers into the
                    slide designs.

                    One of my design goals for this project was to focus the learner’s attention on
                    various animation scenes that would help illustrate the results of their choices. I accomplished
                    this by keeping the overall project design clean and minimal and incorporating more color into
                    the tool animations to make them the visual focus of the course.

                    My goal was to make the
                    different Microsoft tools easily identifiable while sticking to the minimal and simplistic style
                    of the overall project. I designed multiple iterations of each program interface until settling
                    on using the main color of each program in the heading bar along with Microsoft’s default font
                    throughout the project.

                    I continued to iterate each slide type based on the feedback I received, improving the various
                    slide layouts, button colors, and hover states. I edited the cover photo, desk background,
                    computer background, and profile pictures with Adobe Illustrator.

                    storyboard. The visual storyboard combined the text-based storyboard with the visual mock-ups. I
                    also included programming notes indicating the text, graphics, and navigation that appeared on
                    each screen.
                    Once the visual design was finalized, I created a visual storyboard by combining the visual
                    mockups and the text-based storyboard. I added programming notes and other pertinent details to
                    guide development.This was particularly helpful when adding the programming notes, as this
                    project contains many animations that transition from slide to slide with no user interaction.
                    This helped me to stay organized and saved time during the development phase. <img

            <details class="faq-card">
                <summary>Interactive Prototype <span class="faq-open-icon"></span></summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">Once my visual storyboard was complete, I started developing the
                    eLearning experience in Articulate Storyline 360. I used the mockups that I had created in Adobe
                    XD to help guide me.

                    I developed the prototype through the second question. This allowed users to experience the main
                    features of the course including: prompt slides, job aid slides, text-based question slides, and
                    both negative and positive consequence slides which included different stories, animations, and
                    visuals. Once I completed the interactive prototype, I asked my peers, SMEs, and other
                    stakeholders for feedback. I received feedback on animation length and slide transitions, and I
                    made improvements to the experience accordingly.


                    I created an interactive prototype for the project through the first scenario (along with each
                    tool animation slide) using Articulate Storyline 360. Throughout this process, I received
                    feedback from the SME and my peers as I continued to refine the animations and course design.

                    I used the interactive prototype to refine each slide layout and animation, making sure that the
                    triggers and variables worked as designed.I received instructive feedback from a test user to
                    include a way for the learner to participate in each animation. To accomplish this, I added an
                    interactive button to each animation slide, placed at a strategic moment, for the learner to
                    select and perform the action they chose.

                    By creating the interactive prototype in this way, I was able to iterate on my designs before
                    creating the entire project.

            <details class="faq-card">
                <summary>Full Development <span class="faq-open-icon"></span></summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">As I had already designed each slide type in Storyline during the
                    prototype stage, I had a solid platform on which to build the rest of the project. I began by
                    recreating each of the remaining two scenarios using the blueprints from the prototype.

                    Creating the flashing email interactive button was a tough challenge that I solved by trial and
                    error. Combining several different ideas, I solved this challenge by ending the base layer
                    timeline at the moment the learner needed to interact with the slide. I then added a slide layer
                    where the interactive button would flash continuously using variables and conditions. When the
                    learner clicked on the button, the next slide would appear.Making the animation scenes
                    immediately recognizable as Office 365 programs within the overall minimalist project theme was
                    a large part of the development process. However, this effort paid off because the animations
                    allowed for the learner’s decisions to come to life. Making these scenes interactive gave the
                    learner a way to interact and participate in their own decision-making.

                    As all the animations were created in Storyline, some of the difficulties that I dealt with were
                    the complexity of each animation and keeping each timeline organized. The animation slides had
                    many different elements that needed to be animated and matched up with sound effects.

                    I placed sound effects throughout the animations to make the consequences a full audiovisual
                    experience. These sounds were especially important during the email consequence in the third
                    scenario. Hearing the notification ding come faster and faster each time an email response
                    appears really drives home the inefficiency of using email for feedback.I grouped elements
                    together and organized the timeline so that the static elements were at the bottom of the
                    timeline and, as each element was introduced, they would stack on top of the previous element in
                    the timeline. This system allowed me to easily build out the animations and quickly make
                    adjustments to the timing of individual elements without disruption or getting confused.


                    After receiving feedback and making appropriate changes to my interactive prototype, I developed the
                    project completely using Articulate Storyline 360. The process went quickly and smoothly because of
                    the detailed visual storyboard with programming notes I wrote.

                    Some of the highlights of the project include the animation sequence where adult Julia is
                    remembering her either positive or negative memory of being in preschool with celiac disease. I used
                    photoshop to edit and enhance the kitchen background to create a blurred effect that the participant
                    would instantly recognize as 'dream-like’ and then used multiple transitions and animations to get
                    the effect of finding a memory. Another highlight of the project is the review slide at the end. It
                    is a way for learners to easily review the main point from each question. It also includes graphics,
                    which act as a visual reminder of each question’s main objective.

            <details class="faq-card">
                <summary>Results and Takeaways<span class="faq-open-icon"></span></summary>
                <span class="faq-card-spoiler">I learned a lot by going through the entire development process for this
                    project. Working with the SME on the Action Map was the most helpful aspect of this project. It took
                    time and multiple iterations to distill the most impactful situations and make sure that the Action
                    Map was focused on the actions the learner needed to perform. However, the clarity and direction the
                    Action Map provided was crucial to the success of the entire project.


                    If I were to do this project again, I would build out a few more common scenarios for learners to
                    practice choosing efficient communication tools as each tool has its strengths and weaknesses
                    depending on the situation.
                    This project has been received well by cooks and kitchen staff in preschools and cafes as well as
                    those who cook in a shared kitchen with someone who has celiac disease. Learners have enjoyed the
                    experience and have a new awareness of the physical and social impacts of celiac disease. Most
                    importantly, they now have the knowledge and skill to avoid cross-contamination.

                    I am also proud of how I integrated graphics into this project. I have no previous Adobe Illustrator
                    experience, but I created or edited every graphic to maintain a consistent look and feel.

                    Changes ranged from swapping a color to altering vectors to fit a specific purpose. For example,
                    Julia’s altered body positions and expressions, the wilting plant stems, and altered cheese labels.
                    By creating this project, I have deepened my knowledge of Articulate Storyline 360, Adobe XD, Adobe
                    Illustrator, storyboarding, and visual design.

                    One of the most challenging parts of this project was to weave a cohesive story while also educating
                    the learner on an important and serious topic. I knew that strong storytelling was an integral part
                    of this project, and it was necessary that the adult Julia character went beyond just providing more
                    information pertinent to each question. I edited my written storyboard several times in order for
                    the story to flow well and resonate with the learner.

                    I am confident in my new skillset, and I am pleased with how the final product has turned out and
                    with how it has been received thus far. <img src="/src/images/Capture.PNG"
